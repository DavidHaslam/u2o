# u2o
A fast USFM to OSIS bible format converter.

_A better readme still needs to be created.

**CrossWire Bible Society** has not adopted **u2o**.

**u2o** was developed as a potential alternative to https://github.com/chrislit/usfm2osis

The latter was developed for CrossWire, though it's been hardly touched by Chris since 2014.

Since then usfm2osis was forked and further developed by others. That's what CrossWire is currently using.

See also https://github.com/JohnAustinDev/osis-converters which is used for the **IBT** modules repository.

About a year ago, I spent some time working offline developing a copy of u2o.py called u2o2.py

u2o2.py has several changes and enhancements over u2o.py

All my code changes are commented - usually with my initials DFH.
